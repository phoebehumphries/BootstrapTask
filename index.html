	   <p1> The TARDIS is dimensionally transcendental, meaning it is bigger on the inside than the outside.
	   The interior exists in a different, relative dimension to the exterior.
	   In the very first story it was established that the TARDIS usually changes its exterior appearance on each trip to blend in with its surroundings.
	   The Doctor later stated that it was the broken chameleon circuit that caused it to be stuck in the shape of an old style police box.
	   *TARDIS* </p1>
   
   <p2> The TARDIS is supposed to change appearance wherever it lands to blend in with its surroundings.
       When the TARDIS landed in a junkyard on Earth it disguised itself as a police box, when the TARDIS next landed in the year 100,000 BC the exterior didnâ€™t change.
       The Doctor revealed that the chameleon circuit was broken. </p2>
